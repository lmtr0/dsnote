    </release>
    <release version="4.8.0" date="2025-06-19">
      <description>
      <p>General:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Case-sensitive matching in 'Rules'.
          To enable case-sensitive matching in text, use the option 'Case sensitive' in the rule editing form.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Arabic, Catalan, Spanish, Turkish and French-Canadian languages.</li>
      <li>Command line option and DBus API for exporting synthesized speech to an audio file instead of playing it aloud.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New 'CrisperWhisper' model for 'FasterWhisper' engine.
          CrisperWhisper is designed for fast, precise, and verbatim speech recognition with accurate word-level timestamps.
          Unlike the original Whisper, which tends to omit disfluencies and follows more of a intended transcription style,
          CrisperWhisper aims to transcribe every spoken word exactly as it is, including fillers, pauses, stutters and false starts.
          CrisperWhisper model is enabled only for English and German languages.</li>
      <li>'KBLab Whisper' models for Swedish.
          The National Library of Sweden has released fine-tuned STT models trained on its library collections.
          The models have significantly improved accuracy compared to regular Whisper models.
          Even "Tiny" model provides decent quality.
          KBLab models are available as both 'FasterWhisper' and 'WhisperCpp'.</li>
      <li>Using an existing note as the initial context in decoding.
          This has the potential to improve transcription quality and reduce 'hallucination' problem.
          If you observe a degradation in quality, turn off the 'Use note as context' option.</li>
      <li>Option to pause listening while processing.
          This option can be useful when 'Listening mode' is 'Always on'.
          By default, listening continues even when a piece of audio data is being processed.
          Using this option, you can temporarily pause listening for the duration of processing.</li>
      <li>Option to play an audible tone when starting and stopping listening</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Kokoro TTS engine.
          Kokoro is a compact yet powerful open-source multilingual TTS engine.
          Despite its modest size (trained on less than 100 hours of audio), it delivers impressive results.
          Unlike other engines with comparable quality, Kokoro offers the advantage of running even on devices without GPUs.
          Kokoro voices are enabled for: English, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese.</li>
      <li>F5-TTS engine.
          The F5-TTS provides exceptional voice cloning capabilities.
          The currently enabled model works with English and Chinese languages.</li>
      <li>Parler TTS engine. Parler TTS can generate high-quality, natural sounding speech in the style of a given speaker (gender, pitch, speaking style, etc).
          The speaker's characteristics are defined by a text description (prompt).
          Parler TTS primarily supports English, but a multilingual model for French, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, German, Dutch and Italian is also included.</li>
      <li>S.A.M. TTS engine. S.A.M. is a small speech synthesizer designed for the Commodore 64.
          It features a robotic voice that evokes a strong sense of nostalgia.
          The S.A.M. voice is available in English only.</li>
      <li>'Normalize audio' setting option.
          Use this option to enable/disable audio volume normalization.</li>
      <li>New 'Piper' voices for Dutch, Finnish, German and Luxembourgish</li>
      <li>New 'RHVoice' voice for Spanish</li>
      <li>Updated 'RHVoice' voice for Czech</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Translator:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New models: English to Chinese, English to Arabic, Arabic to English, English to Korean, English to Japanese</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accessibility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for 'Insert into active window' under Wayland.
          Using 'start-listening-active-window' or 'start-listening-translate-active-window'
          actions you can directly insert the decoded text into any window which is currently in focus.
          This feature worked under X11 only but now it is also suppored under Wayland.
          For actions to work, 'ydotool' daemon must be installed and running.</li>
      <li>Support for 'Global keyboard shortcuts' under Wayland.
          Until now, this capability was only available under X11.
          Now integration with 'XDG Desktop Portal' has been added, making global keyboard shortcuts possible also under Wayland.
          For shortcuts to work, your desktop enviroment has to support
          'GlobalShortcuts' interface on 'XDG Desktop Portal' service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flatpak:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Python support enabled in 'Tiny' or ARM packages.
          Python libraries are not included in Tiny or ARM packages, but using the 'Location of Python libraries' option,
          you can set an external directory that contains the libraries.</li>
      <li>Flatpak runtime update to version 5.15-24.08</li>
      </ul>

    </release>
    <release version="4.7.0" date="2024-12-28">
      <description>
      <p>General:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Rules for text transformations that can be applied after Speech to Text or before Text to Speech.
          With Rules, you can easily and flexibly correct errors in decoded text or correct mispronounced words.</li>
      <li>New modes for inserting text at the cursor position or replacing the current note.
          To insert text at the cursor position rather than at the end of the note,
          change 'Text appending mode' option to 'Add at the cursor position' in the settings.
          When the 'Replace an existing note' option is set, whenever new text is added, it will replace the existing note.</li>
      <li>DBus API for integration with external applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Slovenian language.</li>
      <li>Status indication in the system tray icon.
          When using the system tray icon, statuses such as processing, listening, etc. are presented with an animated tray icon.</li>
      <li>Models grouped by type in model browser.
          To improve usability, instead of a list containing models of all types, models are grouped by type in separate tabs.</li>
      <li>Command line options for printing available or active model.</li>
      <li>Command line option to print the current status of the application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support for Vulkan GPU acceleration in 'WhisperCpp'.
          Vulkan acceleration enables much faster STT decoding with Intel, AMD or NVIDIA graphics cards.
          The biggest advantage of Vulkan is that you can use it without installing any GPU acceleration add-ons.</li>
      <li>New 'Whisper Large Turbo' model for both 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper'.
          Turbo is a finetuned version of a pruned 'Whisper Large-v3'. It's the exact same model,
          except that the number of decoding layers have reduced. As a result, the model is way faster,
          at the expense of a minor quality degradation.</li>
      <li>Simplified engine configuration options. Instead of multiple options, you can now select a Profile,
          which allows you to change the engine's processing parameters.
          There are three profiles to choose from: 'Best Performance', 'Best Quality' and 'Custom'.</li>
      <li>Echo mode. After processing, the decoded text will be immediately read out using the currently set Text to Speech model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>New 'Piper' voice for Latvian</li>

      <li>Updated models: English to Catalan, English to Russian, English to Ukrainian, English to Czech</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accessibility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Option to scan special keystrokes when setting keyboard shortcuts (X11 only).
          If you want to use special keys as shortcuts (so-called multimedia keys),
          instead of typing their name, you can automatically set the key by pressing it.</li>
      <li>Keyboard shortcuts enabled for several user interface elements.
          Elements such as menu items or buttons can be controlled using the keyboard shortcuts.</li>
      <li>New 'Actions' and global keyboard shortcut to force translation of text in STT:
          'start-listening-translate', 'start-listening-translate-active-window', 'start-listening-translate-clipboard'.
          The decoded text is always translated into English when the "translate" action is triggered.
          This only works when using Whisper models.</li>
      <li>New 'Action' to read text from the command-line option: 'start-reading-text'.
          To pass text, use the '--text' option in the command-line interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flatpak:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>whisper.cpp update to version 1.7.1</li>
      <li>PyTorch update to version 2.5.1</li>
      <li>The Flatpak GPU acceleration add-on for AMD is no longer recommended.
          Better results can be achieved with Vulkan acceleration, which does not require the add-on.</li>
      </ul>

    <release version="4.6.0" date="2024-07-28">
      <description>
      <p>User Interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Speech Note has been translated into Norwegian language.</li>
      <li>Grouped models.
          Models that provide multiple sub-models (for example, TTS models that provide different voices)
          are shown in groups. This makes it easier to find models in the model browser.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech to Text:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The name of the all Whisper models has been changed to 'WhisperCpp' to better reflect the engine behind them.
          Whisper is currently supported by the 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper' engines.
          Both engines are optimized to achieve the best performance.</li>
      <li>Automatic language detection in STT.
          To automatically detect the language during STT, select one of the models that is in the 'Auto detected'
          category in the language list.</li>
      <li>Separate settings for engines.
          The configuration of each engine has been separated in the settings.
          You can separately set the parameters for 'WhisperCpp' and 'FasterWhisper'.
          The new configuration parameters that have been added to the settings are:
          'Number of simultaneous threads', 'Beam search width',
          'Audio context size', 'Use Flash Attention'.</li>
      <li>Quicker decoding with 'WhisperCpp'.
          Optimization for short sentences has been added to 'WhisperCpp' engine. With it, the speed of STT has doubled!</li>
      <li>Support for OpenVINO hardware acceleration in 'WhisperCpp.
          With OpenVINO decoding on CPU is much quicker. If you are not using GPU acceleration,
          it is recommended to enable OpenVINO in 'WhisperCpp' engine settings.
          Currently, OpenVINO is enabled only for CPU acceleration.</li>
      <li>Option for inserting processing statistics.
          New settings option allows inserting processing related information to the text after decoding,
          such as processing time and audio length. This can be useful for comparing the performance of different models,
          engines and their parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text to Speech:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Control tags for advance TTS processing.
          Control tags allow you to dynamically change the speed of synthesized text or add silence between sentences.
          To use control tags, insert '{speed: 0.5}' or '{silence: 1s}' into the text.
          For convenience, you can also insert predefined control tags using text context menu 'Insert control tag'.</li>
      <li>Welsh language. New language is enabled with 'Piper' voice.</li>
      <li>New 'Piper' voices for Spanish, Italian and English</li>
